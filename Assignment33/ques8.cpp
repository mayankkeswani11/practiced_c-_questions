/*8. Create a base class called proof. Use this class to store two int type values that could
be used to prove that triangle is a right angled triangle. Create a class compute
which will determine whether a triangle is a right angled triangle.

Using these classes, design a program that will accept dimensions of a triangle, and
display the result.
(Summary: Prove that triangle is a right angled triangle using pythagoras theorem).*/
